# Constellations

Constellations is an app for creators to create community in order to distribute & monetize their content. 

This project is a platform built on Lens where creators can have their communities & convert from short form content fans (think TikTok) to long form content fans (think Youtube) to paid community members (think Patreon) all in one place.

We use NFTs to create memberships for fans to purchase and allow creators to monetize with other NFT assets like collectibles, content as NFTs, fractional revenue share, etc.

# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
