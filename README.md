# Constellations

Constellations is an app for creators to connect through community, and enables them to distribute & monetize their content.

This project is a platform built on Lens, Livepeer, Polygon, The Graph, & XMTP where creators can have their communities & convert from short form content fans (think TikTok) to long form content fans (think Youtube) to paid community members (think Patreon) all in one place.

You can upload videos that will get uploaded to a Polygon contract & connect/explore with different communities on Lens protocol. Currently you can also send messages through XMTP protocol to other addresses as well.

In the future I'd like to enable creators to generate subscription memberships, share video content through chat, & token gate publications..

# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
